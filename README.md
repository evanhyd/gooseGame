Honk Honk welcome to the goose kingdom!

Have you ever wanted to live with geese? Because if you are, you are in luck! In goose kingdom you can feed, pet and level up geese. There are 6 different unique food at different
prices to grant different nutrients to level up the geese. In case you are broke, you can pet the geese for fun as one of the best ways to build up your long term relationship 
with your geese. Once they level up, they can develop unique characteristics. Once they reach the highest level, they can be divided into the 6 different waterloo faculty. Goose 
kingdom also supports the feature of mating. Once a pair of goose is level 18+ and are close to each other, they will start to produce baby goose. Baby goose are also unique 
because they can inherit their parent's name and faculties. 



TLDR: This is a goose farm simulator game submitted as a project for the se26 hackathon. Long live the waterloo geese #gooseLifeMatters!
